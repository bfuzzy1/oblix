# Kaizen Log

> "Kaizen (改善) – 1% better every day" - Japanese-Level Code Quality Rule-Book

## Daily Kaizen Tracking

### 2024-01-XX - Japanese-Level Code Quality Implementation
**Target:** Establish foundation for continuous improvement
**Achievement:** ✅ Complete
- Added ESLint with craftsmanship-focused rules
- Created Prettier configuration for consistent formatting
- Implemented quality gates with automated checks
- Added CHANGELOG for tracking improvements
- Created code review checklist
- Established daily kaizen script

**Next Target:** Refactor main.js into smaller, focused modules

## Kaizen Principles Applied

### Monozukuri (Craftsmanship)
- Treating every line as a product meant to last decades
- Code quality is the feature
- Focus on craftsmanship over cleverness

### Kaizen (Continuous Improvement)
- 1% better every day
- No "tech-debt sprints"
- Continuous polish instead of big refactors

### Sustainable Pace
- Work rhythm that can be maintained for 20 years
- No crunches, no burnout
- Focus on maintainable improvements

### Wabi-sabi (Graceful Imperfection)
- Ship the simplest code that solves today's need
- Easy to evolve tomorrow
- Avoid speculative "just in case" complexity

## Weekly Reflection (Hansei)

### Week of 2024-01-XX
**Three specific improvements for next round:**

1. **Refactor large functions** - Break down main.js functions > 50 lines
2. **Add comprehensive JSDoc** - Document all public functions and classes
3. **Implement test coverage reporting** - Ensure edge cases are covered

**What went well:**
- Successfully established quality foundation
- Team embraced craftsmanship mindset
- Automated quality gates working

**What could be improved:**
- Need more granular kaizen targets
- Should track improvement metrics
- Could benefit from pair programming sessions
